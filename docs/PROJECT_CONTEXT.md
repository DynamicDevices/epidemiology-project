# Project context (living document)

## One-sentence goal

> TODO: e.g. “Use real public health data to answer a clear epidemiology question with simple maths + clear visuals.”

## Research question (pick one)

- Option A (time-series): TODO
- Option B (SIR/SEIR model): TODO
- Option C (excess mortality): TODO

### Suggested (UK + infectious + respiratory)

> **How do RSV and influenza seasons differ in timing and magnitude in England, and what changed before/after the COVID period?**

Minimum viable analysis:
- pull weekly **testing positivity** (RSV vs influenza) for England
- smooth / plot both series
- estimate and compare **peak week** and **peak value** each season/year

## Scope (keep it small)

- **Geography**: TODO (e.g. UK, England regions, one country)
- **Time window**: TODO
- **Outcomes**: TODO (cases / hospitalisations / deaths / excess deaths)

## Team roles (suggested)

- **Data**: ingestion + cleaning + dataset documentation
- **Analysis**: computations + model fitting
- **Visuals**: figures for poster/report + styling
- **Write-up**: narrative + limitations + references

## Outputs

- `notebooks/`: analysis notebooks
- `reports/`: report/poster/slides (export final figures to `reports/figures/`)
